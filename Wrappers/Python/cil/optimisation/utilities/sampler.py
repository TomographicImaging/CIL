class SamplerFromFunction():
    """     
        A class that wraps a function that takes an iteration number and selects from a list of indices {0, 1, …, S-1}.

        The function next() outputs a single next index from the list {0,1,…,S-1}.To be run again and again, depending on how many iterations.

        It is recommended to use the static methods to configure your Sampler object rather than initialising this class directly: the user should call this through Sampler.from_function(num_indices, function, prob_weights) from cil.optimisation.utilities.sampler.

        Parameters
        ----------

        function: A function that takes an in integer iteration number and returns an integer from {0, 1, …, S-1} with S=num_indices. 

        num_indices: int
            One above the largest integer that could be drawn by the sampler. The sampler will select from a list of indices {0, 1, …, S-1} with S=num_indices. 

        sampling_type:strm default='from_function"
            The sampling type used. Choose from "sequential", "staggered", "herman_meyer" and "from_function". 

        prob_weights: list of floats of length num_indices that sum to 1.  Default is [1/num_indices]*num_indices 
            Consider that the sampler is called a large number of times this argument holds the expected number of times each index would be called,  normalised to 1. 

        Returns
        -------
        A Sampler wrapping a function that can be called with Sampler.next()  or next(Sampler)

        Example
        -------    
        >>> sampler=Sampler.staggered(21,4)
        >>> print(sampler.get_samples(5))
        [ 0  4  8 12 16]

        Example
        -------
        >>> sampler=Sampler.sequential(10)
        >>> print(sampler.get_samples(5))
        [0 1 2 3 4]

        Example
        -------
        >>> sampler=Sampler.herman_meyer(12)
        >>> print(sampler.get_samples(16))
        [ 0  6  3  9  1  7  4 10  2  8  5 11  0  6  3  9]


        Example
        -------
        This example creates a sampler that uniformly randomly with replacement samples from the numbers {0,1,...,48} for the first 500 iterations. 
        For the next 500 iterations it uniformly randomly with replacement samples from {0,...,49}. The num_indices is 50 and the prob_weights are left as default because in the limit all indices will be seen with equal probability. 
        >>> def test_function(iteration_number):
        >>>     if iteration_number<500:
        >>>         np.random.seed(iteration_number)
        >>>         return(np.random.choice(49,1)[0])
        >>>     else:
        >>>         np.random.seed(iteration_number)
        >>>         return(np.random.choice(50,1)[0])
        >>>
        >>> Sampler.from_function(num_indices, function, prob_weights=None)
        >>> print(list(sampler.get_samples(25)))
        [44, 37, 40, 42, 46, 35, 10, 47, 3, 28, 9, 25, 11, 18, 43, 8, 41, 47, 42, 29, 35, 9, 4, 19, 34]


        Example
        -------
        This example creates a sampler that samples in order from a custom list. The num_indices  is 13, although note that the index 12 is never called by the sampler. The number of indices must be at least one greater than any of the elements in the custom_list. 
        The probability weights are calculated and passed to the sampler as they are not uniform. 

        >>> custom_list=[1,1,1,0,0,11,5,9,8,3]
        >>> num_indices=13
        >>> 
        >>> def test_function(iteration_number, custom_list=custom_list):
            return(custom_list[iteration_number%len(custom_list)])
        >>> 
        >>> #calculate prob weights 
        >>> temp_list = []
        >>> for i in range(num_indices):
        >>>     temp_list.append(custom_list.count(i))
        >>> total = sum(temp_list)
        >>> prob_weights = [x/total for x in temp_list]
        >>> 
        >>> sampler=Sampler.from_function(num_indices=num_indices, function=test_function, prob_weights=prob_weights)
        >>> print(list(sampler.get_samples(25)))
        [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 11, 5, 9, 8, 3, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 11, 5, 9, 8, 3, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]
        >>> print(sampler)

        Note
        -----
        If your function involves a random number generator, then the seed should also depend on the iteration number, see the first example in the documentation, otherwise
        the `get_samples()` function may not accurately return the correct samples and may interrupt the next sample returned.

class Sampler():

    r"""
    This class follows the factory design pattern. It is not instantiated but has 6 static methods that will return instances of 6 different samplers, which require a variety of parameters.

    Each factory method will instantiate a  class to select from the list of indices `{0, 1, …, S-1}, where S is the number of indices.`.

    Common in each instantiated  class, the function `next()` outputs a single next index from the list {0,1,…,S-1}. Each class also has a `get_samples(n)` function which will output the first `n` samples. 

    Example
    -------
    >>> sampler=Sampler.sequential(10)
    >>> print(sampler.get_samples(5))
    [0 1 2 3 4]


    Example
    -------
    >>> sampler=Sampler.random_with_replacement(5)
    >>> print(sampler.get_samples())
    [3 4 0 0 2 3 3 2 2 1 1 4 4 3 0 2 4 4 2 4]

    Note
    -----
    The optimal choice of sampler depends on the data and the number of calls to the sampler. 

    For random sampling with replacement, there is the possibility, with a small number of calls to the sampler that some indices will not have been selected. For the case of uniform probabilities, the default, the number of
    iterations required such that the probability that all indices have been selected at least once is greater than :math:`p` grows as :math:`nlog(n/p)` where `n` is `num_indices`. 
    For example, to be 99% certain that you have seen all indices, for `n=20` you should take at least 152 samples, `n=50` at least 426 samples. To be more likely than not, for `n=20` you should take 78 samples and `n=50` you should take 228 samples. 
    In general, we note that for a large number of samples (e.g. `>20*num_indices`), the density of the outputted samples looks more and more uniform. For a small number of samples (e.g. `<5*num_indices`) the user may wish to consider
    another sampling method e.g. random without replacement, which, when calling `num_indices` samples is guaranteed to draw each index exactly once.

        ----------
        num_indices: int
            One above the largest integer that could be drawn by the sampler. The sampler will select from a list of indices {0, 1, …, S-1} with S=num_indices. 

        function: A function that takes an in integer iteration number and returns an integer from {0, 1, …, S-1} with S=num_indices. 

        prob_weights: list of floats of length num_indices that sum to 1. Default is [1/num_indices]*num_indices 
            Consider that the sampler is called a large number of times this argument holds the expected number of times each index would be called,  normalised to 1. 


        Note
        -----
        If your function involves a random number generator, then the seed should also depend on the iteration number, see the example in the documentation, otherwise
        the `get_samples()` function may not accurately return the correct samples and may interrupt the next sample returned. 

        Returns
        -------
        A Sampler that wraps a function and can be called with Sampler.next()  or next(Sampler) 
        -------
        This example creates a sampler that uniformly randomly with replacement samples from the numbers {0,1,...,48} for the first 500 iterations. 
        For the next 500 iterations it uniformly randomly with replacement samples from {0,...,49}. The num_indices is 50 and the prob_weights are left as default because in the limit all indices will be seen with equal probability.

        Example
        -------
        This example creates a sampler that samples in order from a custom list. The num_indices  is 13, although note that the index 12 is never called by the sampler. The number of indices must be at least one greater than any of the elements in the custom_list. 
        The probability weights are calculated and passed to the sampler as they are not uniform. 

        >>> custom_list=[1,1,1,0,0,11,5,9,8,3]
        >>> num_indices=13
        >>> 
        >>> def test_function(iteration_number, custom_list=custom_list):
            return(custom_list[iteration_number%len(custom_list)])
        >>> 
        >>> #calculate prob weights 
        >>> temp_list = []
        >>> for i in range(num_indices):
        >>>     temp_list.append(custom_list.count(i))
        >>> total = sum(temp_list)
        >>> prob_weights = [x/total for x in temp_list]
        >>>
