            The sampling type used. Choose from "sequential", "custom_order", "herman_meyer", "staggered", "random_with_replacement" and "random_without_replacement".


        function: A function that takes an in integer iteration number and returns an integer from {0, 1, …, S-1} with S=num_indices. 

        prob_weights: list of floats of length num_indices that sum to 1.  Default is [1/num_indices]*num_indices #TODO: write unit tests.

        -----

        the get_samples() function may not accurately return the correct samples and may interrupt the next sample returned.

    Note
    -----
    The optimal choice of sampler depends on the data and the number of calls to the sampler. 

    For random sampling with replacement, there is the possibility, with a small number of calls to the sampler that some indices will not have been selected. For the case of uniform probabilities, the default, the number of
    iterations required such that the probability that all indices have been selected at least once is greater than :math:`p` grows as :math:`nlog(n/p)` where `n` is `num_indices`. 
    For example, to be 99% certain that you have seen all indices, for `n=20` you should take at least 152 samples, `n=50` at least 426 samples. To be more likely than not, for `n=20` you should take 78 samples and `n=50` you should take 228 samples. 
    In general, we note that for a large number of samples (e.g. `>20*num_indices`), the density of the outputted samples looks more and more uniform. For a small number of samples (e.g. `<5*num_indices`) the user may wish to consider
    another sampling method e.g. random without replacement, which, when calling `num_indices` samples is guaranteed to draw each index exactly once.

        A class that wraps a function that takes an iteration number and selects from a list of indices {0, 1, …, S-1}.
        The function next() outputs a single next index from the list {0,1,…,S-1}.To be run again and again, depending on how many iterations.


        Parameters
        ----------
        num_indices: int
            The sampler will select from a list of indices {0, 1, …, S-1} with S=num_indices. 

        sampling_type:str
            The sampling type used. Choose from "sequential", "custom_order", "herman_meyer", "staggered", "random_with_replacement" and "random_without_replacement".

        function: A function that takes an in integer iteration number and returns an integer from {0, 1, …, S-1} with S=num_indices. 

        prob_weights: list of floats of length num_indices that sum to 1. Default is [1/num_indices]*num_indices 
            Consider that the sampler is called a large number of times this argument holds the expected number of times each index would be called,  normalised to 1. 


        Note
        -----
        If your function involves a random number generator, then the seed should also depend on the iteration number, see the example in the documentation, otherwise
        the get_samples() function may not accurately return the correct samples and may interrupt the next sample returned.
