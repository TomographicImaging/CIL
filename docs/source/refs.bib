abstract={In this paper we study a first-order primal-dual algorithm for non-smooth convex optimization problems with known saddle-point structure. We prove convergence to a saddle-point with rate O(1/N) in finite dimensions for the complete class of problems. We further show accelerations of the proposed algorithm to yield improved rates on problems with some degree of smoothness. In particular we show that we can achieve O(1/N2) convergence on problems, where the primal or the dual objective is uniformly convex, and we can show linear convergence, i.e. O($\omega$N) for some $\omega$∈(0,1), on smooth problems. The wide applicability of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated on several imaging problems such as image denoising, image deconvolution, image inpainting, motion estimation and multi-label image segmentation.},

CIL provides building blocks for tailored regularized reconstruction algorithms and explicitly supports multichannel tomographic data. In the first part of this two-part publication, we introduced the fundamentals of CIL. This paper focuses on applications of CIL for multichannel data, e.g. dynamic and spectral. We formalize different optimization problems for colour processing, dynamic and hyperspectral tomography and demonstrate CILβs capabilities for designing state-of-the-art reconstruction methods through case studies and code snapshots.

    abstract = { We present the Core Imaging Library (CIL), an open-source Python framework for tomographic imaging with particular emphasis on reconstruction of challenging datasets. Conventional filtered back-projection reconstruction tends to be insufficient for highly noisy, incomplete, non-standard or multi-channel data arising for example in dynamic, spectral and in situ tomography. CIL provides an extensive modular optimization framework for prototyping reconstruction methods including sparsity and total variation regularization, as well as tools for loading, preprocessing and visualizing tomographic data. The capabilities of CIL are demonstrated on a synchrotron example dataset and three challenging cases spanning golden-ratio neutron tomography, cone-beam X-ray laminography and positron emission tomography.

abstract={We investigate the convergence of a recently popular class of first-order primal--dual algorithms for saddle point problems under the presence of errors in the proximal maps and gradients. We study several types of errors and show that, provided a sufficient decay of these errors, the same convergence rates as for the error-free algorithm can be established. More precisely, we prove the (optimal) {\$}{\$}O{\backslash}left( 1/N{\backslash}right){\$}{\$} convergence to a saddle point in finite dimensions for the class of non-smooth problems considered in this paper, and prove a {\$}{\$}O{\backslash}left( 1/N^2{\backslash}right){\$}{\$} or even linear {\$}{\$}O{\backslash}left( {\backslash}theta ^N{\backslash}right){\$}{\$} convergence rate if either the primal or dual objective respectively both are strongly convex. Moreover we show that also under a slower decay of errors we can establish rates, however slower and directly depending on the decay of the errors. We demonstrate the performance and practical use of the algorithms on the example of nested algorithms and show how they can be used to split the global objective more efficiently.},

number={3},
pages={377-400},
abstract={Image restoration models based on total variation (TV) have become popular since their introduction by Rudin, Osher, and Fatemi (ROF) in 1992. The dual formulation of this model has a quadratic objective with separable constraints, making projections onto the feasible set easy to compute. This paper proposes application of gradient projection (GP) algorithms to the dual formulation. We test variants of GP with different step length selection and line search strategies, including techniques based on the Barzilai-Borwein method. Global convergence can in some cases be proved by appealing to existing theory. We also propose a sequential quadratic programming (SQP) approach that takes account of the curvature of the boundary of the dual feasible set. Computational experiments show that the proposed approaches perform well in a wide range of applications and that some are significantly faster than previously proposed methods, particularly when only modest accuracy in the solution is required.},

    abstract = { We show that various inverse problems in signal recovery can be formulated as the generic problem of minimizing the sum of two convex functions with certain regularity properties. This formulation makes it possible to derive existence, uniqueness, characterization, and stability results in a unified and standardized fashion for a large class of apparently disparate problems. Recent results on monotone operator splitting methods are applied to establish the convergence of a forward-backward algorithm to solve the generic problem. In turn, we recover, extend, and provide a simplified analysis for a variety of existing iterative methods. Applications to geometry/texture image decomposition schemes are also discussed. A novelty of our framework is to use extensively the notion of a proximity operator, which was introduced by Moreau in the 1960s. }
