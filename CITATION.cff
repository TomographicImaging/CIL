  The Core Imaging Library (CIL) is an open-source Python framework for tomographic imaging
  with particular emphasis on reconstruction of challenging datasets. Conventional filtered
  backprojection reconstruction tends to be insufficient for highly noisy, incomplete, non-standard
  or multichannel data arising for example in dynamic, spectral and in situ tomography. CIL
  provides an extensive modular optimisation framework for prototyping reconstruction methods
  including sparsity and total variation regularisation, as well as tools for loading, preprocessing
  and visualising tomographic data.
