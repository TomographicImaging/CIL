abstract={In this paper we study a first-order primal-dual algorithm for non-smooth convex optimization problems with known saddle-point structure. We prove convergence to a saddle-point with rate O(1/N) in finite dimensions for the complete class of problems. We further show accelerations of the proposed algorithm to yield improved rates on problems with some degree of smoothness. In particular we show that we can achieve O(1/N2) convergence on problems, where the primal or the dual objective is uniformly convex, and we can show linear convergence, i.e. O($\omega$N) for some $\omega$∈(0,1), on smooth problems. The wide applicability of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated on several imaging problems such as image denoising, image deconvolution, image inpainting, motion estimation and multi-label image segmentation.},

    abstract = { The newly developed core imaging library (CIL) is a flexible plug and play library for tomographic imaging with a specific focus on iterative reconstruction. CIL provides building blocks for tailored regularized reconstruction algorithms and explicitly supports multichannel tomographic data. In the first part of this two-part publication, we introduced the fundamentals of CIL. This paper focuses on applications of CIL for multichannel data, e.g. dynamic and spectral. We formalize different optimization problems for colour processing, dynamic and hyperspectral tomography and demonstrate CILβs capabilities for designing state-of-the-art reconstruction methods through case studies and code snapshots.

    abstract = { We present the Core Imaging Library (CIL), an open-source Python framework for tomographic imaging with particular emphasis on reconstruction of challenging datasets. Conventional filtered back-projection reconstruction tends to be insufficient for highly noisy, incomplete, non-standard or multi-channel data arising for example in dynamic, spectral and in situ tomography. CIL provides an extensive modular optimization framework for prototyping reconstruction methods including sparsity and total variation regularization, as well as tools for loading, preprocessing and visualizing tomographic data. The capabilities of CIL are demonstrated on a synchrotron example dataset and three challenging cases spanning golden-ratio neutron tomography, cone-beam X-ray laminography and positron emission tomography.
