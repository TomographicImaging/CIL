class AstraProjector2D(LinearOperator):
    """
    AstraProjector2D configures and calls the ASTRA 2D Projectors for CPU and GPU.
    It is recommended to use this via the ProjectionOperator Class.

    Parameters
    ----------

    image_geometry : ImageGeometry
        A description of the area/volume to reconstruct

    acquisition_geometry : AcquisitionGeometry
        A description of the acquisition data

    device : string, default='gpu'
        The device to run on 'gpu' or 'cpu'

    Example
    -------
    >>> from cil.plugins.astra import AstraProjector2D
    >>> PO = AstraProjector2D(image.geometry, data.geometry)
    >>> forward_projection = PO.direct(image)
    >>> backward_projection = PO.adjoint(data)
