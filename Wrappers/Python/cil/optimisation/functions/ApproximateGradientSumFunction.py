class ApproximateGradientSumFunction(SumFunction, ABC):
    r"""ApproximateGradientSumFunction represents the following sum 

    .. math:: \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} f_{i} = (f_{0} + f_{2} + ... + f_{n-1})

    where there are :math:`n` functions. This function class has two ways of calling gradient
    
        - `full_gradient` calculates the gradient of the sum :math:`\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \nabla f_{i}`
        - `gradient` calls an `approximate_gradient` function which may be less computationally expensive to calculate than the full gradient
    
    

    This class is an abstract class.

    Parameters
    -----------
    functions : `list`  of functions
        A list of functions: :math:`[f_{0}, f_{2}, ..., f_{n-1}]`. Each function is assumed to be smooth with an implemented :func:`~Function.gradient` method. All functions must have the same domain. The number of functions (equivalently the length of the list) must be strictly greater than 1. 
    sampler: An instance of a CIL Sampler class ( :meth:`~optimisation.utilities.sampler`) or of another class which has a :code:`__next__` function implemented to output integers in :math:`{0,...,n-1}`.
        This sampler is called each time :code:`gradient` is called and sets the internal :code:`function_num` passed to the :code:`approximate_gradient` function.  Default is :code:`Sampler.random_with_replacement(len(functions))`. 

    Note
    -----
    We ensure that the approximate gradient is of a similar order of magnitude to the full gradient calculation. For example, in the :code:`SGFunction` we approximate the full gradient by :math:`n\nabla f_i` for an index :math:`i` given by the sampler. 
    The multiplication by :math:`n` is a choice to more easily allow comparisons between stochastic and non-stochastic methods and between stochastic methods with varying numbers of subsets. 

    Note
    -----
    Each time :code:`gradient` is called the class keeps track of which functions have been used to calculate the gradient. This may be useful for debugging or plotting after using this function in an iterative algorithm.  
    
        - The property :code:`data_passes_indices` is a list of lists holding the indices of the functions that are processed in each call of `gradient`. This list is updated each time `gradient` is called by appending a list of the indices of the functions used to calculate the gradient. 
        - The property :code:`data_passes` is a list of floats that holds the amount of data that has been processed up until each call of `gradient`. This list is updated each time `gradient` is called by appending the proportion of the data used when calculating the approximate gradient since the class was initialised (a full gradient calculation would be 1 full data pass). Warning: if your functions do not contain an equal `amount` of data, for example your data was not partitioned into equal batches, then you must first use the `set_data_partition_weights" function for this to be accurate.    



    Note
    ----
    The :meth:`~ApproximateGradientSumFunction.gradient` returns the approximate gradient depending on an index provided by the  :code:`sampler` method. 

    Example
    -------
    This class is an abstract base class, so we give an example using the SGFunction child class. 
    
    Consider the objective is to minimise: 

    .. math:: \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} f_{i}(x) = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\|A_{i} x - b_{i}\|^{2}

    >>> list_of_functions = [LeastSquares(Ai, b=bi)] for Ai,bi in zip(A_subsets, b_subsets))   
    >>> f = ApproximateGradientSumFunction(list_of_functions) 

    >>> list_of_functions = [LeastSquares(Ai, b=bi)] for Ai,bi in zip(A_subsets, b_subsets)) 
    >>> sampler = Sampler.sequential(len(list_of_functions))
    >>> f = SGFunction(list_of_functions, sampler=sampler)   
    >>> f.full_gradient(x)
    This will return :math:`\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \nabla f_{i}(x)`
    >>> f.gradient(x)
    As per the approximate gradient implementation in the SGFunction this will return :math:`\nabla f_{0}`. The choice of the `0` index is because we chose a `sequential` sampler and this is the first time we called `gradient`. 
    >>> f.gradient(x)
    This will return :math:`\nabla f_{1}` because we chose  a `sequential` sampler and this is the second time we called `gradient`.
