Framework
*********


AcquisitionGeometry
===================

The :code:`AcquisitionGeometry` class holds the system acquisition parameters.

.. autoclass:: cil.framework.AcquisitionGeometry

We create the appropriate :code:`AcquisitionGeometry` for our data by using the static methods:

Parallel2D Geometry
-------------------
.. automethod:: cil.framework.AcquisitionGeometry.create_Parallel2D

Parallel3D Geometry
-------------------
.. automethod:: cil.framework.AcquisitionGeometry.create_Parallel3D

Cone2D Geometry (Fanbeam)
-------------------------
.. automethod:: cil.framework.AcquisitionGeometry.create_Cone2D

Cone3D Geometry
---------------
.. automethod:: cil.framework.AcquisitionGeometry.create_Cone3D


Configure the geometry
----------------------
This gives us an acquisition geometry object configured with the spatial geometry of the system.

It is then necessary to configure the panel, angular data and dimension labels:

.. automethod:: cil.framework.AcquisitionGeometry.set_panel
.. automethod:: cil.framework.AcquisitionGeometry.set_angles
.. automethod:: cil.framework.AcquisitionGeometry.set_labels
.. automethod:: cil.framework.AcquisitionGeometry.set_channels


Use the geometry
----------------
We can use this geometry to generate related objects. Including a 2D slice :code:`AcquisitionGeometry`, an :code:`AcquisitionData` container, and a default :code:`ImageGeometry`.

.. automethod:: cil.framework.AcquisitionGeometry.get_slice
.. automethod:: cil.framework.AcquisitionGeometry.allocate
.. automethod:: cil.framework.AcquisitionGeometry.get_ImageGeometry



ImageGeometry
=============


The :code:`ImageGeometry` class holds meta data describing the reconstruction volume of interest. This will be centred on the rotation axis position defined
in :code:`AcquisitionGeometry`, with the z-direction aligned with the rotation axis direction.

.. autoclass:: cil.framework.ImageGeometry
   :members:


BlockGeometry
=============

.. autoclass:: cil.framework.BlockGeometry
   :members:
   :inherited-members:



Data Containers
===============

:code:`AcquisitionData` and :code:`ImageData` inherit from the same parent :code:`DataContainer` class,
therefore they largely behave the same way.

There are algebraic operations defined for both :code:`AcquisitionData` and :code:`ImageData`.
Following operations are defined:

* binary operations (between two DataContainers or scalar and DataContainer)

  * :code:`+` addition
  * :code:`-` subtraction
  * :code:`/` division
  * :code:`*` multiplication
  * :code:`**` power
  * :code:`maximum`
  * :code:`minimum`

* in-place operations

  * :code:`+=`
  * :code:`-=`
  * :code:`*=`
  * :code:`**=`
  * :code:`/=`

* unary operations

  * :code:`abs`
  * :code:`sqrt`
  * :code:`sign`
  * :code:`conjugate`

* reductions

  * :code:`sum`
  * :code:`norm`
  * :code:`dot` product


DataContainer

.. autoclass:: cil.framework.DataContainer
   :members:
   :inherited-members:

AcquisitionData
---------------

.. autoclass:: cil.framework.AcquisitionData
   :members:
   :inherited-members:

ImageData
---------

.. autoclass:: cil.framework.ImageData
   :members:
   :inherited-members:

VectorData
----------

.. autoclass:: cil.framework.VectorData
   :members:
   :inherited-members:


BlockDataContainer
------------------

A :code:`BlockDataContainer` can be instantiated from a number of `DataContainer`_ and subclasses
represents a column vector of :code:`DataContainer` s.

.. code:: python

  bdc = BlockDataContainer(DataContainer0, DataContainer1)

This provide a base class that will behave as normal :code:`DataContainer`.

.. autoclass:: cil.framework.BlockDataContainer
   :members:
   :inherited-members:

DataOrder
=========
.. autoclass:: cil.framework.DataOrder
   :members:
