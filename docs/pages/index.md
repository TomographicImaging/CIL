## A versatile python framework for tomographic imaging

CIL is an **open-source** mainly Python framework for tomographic imaging for *cone* and *parallel beam* geometries. It comes with tools for **loading**, **preprocessing**, **reconstructing** and **visualising** tomographic data.

CIL provides **optimised** standard methods such as *Filtered Back Projection* and *FDK* and an extensive **modular optimisation framework** for prototyping reconstruction methods including *sparsity* and *total variation* regularisation, useful when conventional filtered backprojection reconstruction do not lead to satisfactory results, as in highly noisy, incomplete, non-standard or multichannel data arising for example in *dynamic*, *spectral* and *in situ* tomography.

CIL is open-source software released under the [Apache v2.0 licence](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html).
