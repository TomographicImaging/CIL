# CIL - Core Imaging Library
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/TomographicImaging/CIL-Demos/HEAD?urlpath=lab/tree/binder%2Findex.ipynb)

The Core Imaging Library (CIL) is an open-source Python framework for tomographic imaging with particular emphasis on reconstruction of challenging datasets. Conventional filtered backprojection reconstruction tends to be insufficient for highly noisy, incomplete, non-standard or multichannel data arising for example in dynamic, spectral and in situ tomography. CIL provides an extensive modular optimisation framework for prototyping reconstruction methods including sparsity and total variation regularisation, as well as tools for loading, preprocessing and visualising tomographic data.


## Documentation

The documentation for CIL can be accessed [here](https://tomographicimaging.github.io/CIL).


# Installation of CIL

Binary installation of CIL can be achieved with `conda` or `mamba`. `mamba`'s environment solver (`libmamba`) provides faster environment resolution so we recommend this route, although in many cases the default `conda` will still work but may be very slow.

`miniconda` is a minimal installer for `conda`. Installation instructions can be found [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/).
You can then force your `conda` installation to use `libmamba` instructions are [here](https://www.anaconda.com/blog/a-faster-conda-for-a-growing-community).

Alternatively, `mamba` can be installed via [`miniforge`](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge) which is another minimal installer for `conda` with optional support for `mamba`. In this case replace `conda` with `mamba` in the below commands.

Install a new environment using:

```bash
conda create --name cil -c conda-forge -c intel -c ccpi cil=23.1.0
```

To install CIL and the additional packages and plugins needed to run the [CIL demos](https://github.com/TomographicImaging/CIL-Demos) install the environment with:

```bash
conda create --name cil -c conda-forge -c intel -c ccpi cil=23.1.0 astra-toolbox tigre ccpi-regulariser tomophantom "ipywidgets<8"
```
where,

```astra-toolbox``` will allow you to use CIL with the [ASTRA toolbox](http://www.astra-toolbox.com/) projectors (GPLv3 license).

```tigre``` will allow you to use CIL with the [TIGRE](https://github.com/CERN/TIGRE) toolbox projectors (BSD license).

```ccpi-regulariser``` will give you access to the [CCPi Regularisation Toolkit](https://github.com/vais-ral/CCPi-Regularisation-Toolkit).

```tomophantom``` [Tomophantom](https://github.com/dkazanc/TomoPhantom) will allow you to generate phantoms to use as test data.

```cudatoolkit``` If you have GPU drivers compatible with more recent CUDA versions you can modify this package selector (installing tigre via conda requires 10.2).


## Dependency

CIL's [optimised FDK/FBP](https://github.com/TomographicImaging/CIL/discussions/1070) `recon` module requires:
1. the Intel [Integrated Performance Primitives](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/ipp.html#gs.gxwq5p) Library ([license](https://www.intel.com/content/dam/develop/external/us/en/documents/pdf/intel-simplified-software-license-version-august-2021.pdf)) which can be installed via conda from the `intel` [channel](https://anaconda.org/intel/ipp).
2. [TIGRE](https://github.com/CERN/TIGRE), which can be installed via conda from the `ccpi` channel.

# Building CIL from source code 

## Getting the code

In case of development it is useful to be able to build the software directly. You should clone this repository as
```bash

git clone --recurse-submodule git@github.com:TomographicImaging/CIL.git
```
The use of `--recurse-submodule` is necessary if the user wants the examples data to be fetched (they are needed by the unit tests). We have moved such data, previously hosted in this repo at `Wrappers/Python/data` to the [CIL-data](https://github.com/TomographicImaging/CIL-Data) repository and linked it to this one as submodule. If the data is not available it can be fetched in an already cloned repository as
```bash

git submodule update --init
```

## Build dependencies
To create a conda environment with all the dependencies for building CIL run the following `bash` script:

```bash
sh scripts/create_local_env_for_cil_development.sh -n NUMPY_VERSION -p PYTHON_VERSION -e ENVIRONMENT_NAME
```

Or with the CIL build and test dependencies:
```bash
sh scripts/create_local_env_for_cil_development_tests.sh -n NUMPY_VERSION -p PYTHON_VERSION -e ENVIRONMENT_NAME
```

And then install CIL in to this environment using CMake.

Alternatively, one can use the `scripts/requirements-test.yml` to create a conda environment with all the 
appropriate dependencies on any OS, using the following command:

```
conda env create -f scripts/requirements-test.yml
```


## Build with CMake

CMake and a C++ compiler are required to build the source code. Let's suppose that the user is in the source directory, then the following commands should work:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<install_directory>
cmake --build . --target install
```

If targeting an active conda environment then the `<install_directory>` can be set to the `CONDA_PREFIX` environment variable, `${CONDA_PREFIX}` in bash, or `%CONDA_PREFIX%` if using Anaconda Prompt on Windows.

If not installing to a conda environment then the user will also need to set the locations of the IPP library and includes, and the path to CIL.

By default the location of the IPP library and includes is `${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/lib` and `${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/include` respectively. To pass the location of the IPP library and headers please pass the following parameters:

```bash

cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<install_directory> -DIPP_LIBRARY=<path_to_ipp_library> -DIPP_INCLUDE=<path_to_ipp_includes>
```

The user will then need to add the path `<install_directory>/lib` to the environment variable `PATH` or `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, depending on system OS.
