User showcase
*************
This page contains example notebooks demonstrating how CIL users have solved a variety of interesting problems using CIL tools. Click below to see the rendered notebooks, or access and run the code yourself from https://github.com/TomographicImaging/CIL-User-Showcase/tree/main 
Note: each notebook has been tested on a specified version of CIL version and is not guaranteed to run on the latest CIL release
