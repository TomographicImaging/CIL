Welcome to CIL's documentation!
###############################

The aim of this package is to enable rapid prototyping of optimisation-based
reconstruction problems, i.e. defining and solving different optimization problems to enforce different properties on the reconstructed image, while being
powerful enough to be employed on real scale problems.

Firstly, it provides a framework to handle acquisition and reconstruction
data and metadata; it also provides a basic input/output package to read data
from different sources, e.g. Nikon X-Radia, NeXus.

Secondly, it provides an object-oriented framework for defining mathematical
operators and functions as well a collection of useful example operators and
functions. Both smooth and non-smooth functions can be used.

Further, it provides a number of high-level generic implementations of
optimisation algorithms to solve generically formulated optimisation problems
constructed from operator and function objects.
