abstract: "The Core Imaging Library (CIL) is an open-source Python framework for tomographic imaging
           with particular emphasis on reconstruction of challenging datasets. Conventional filtered
           backprojection reconstruction tends to be insufficient for highly noisy, incomplete, non-standard
           or multichannel data arising for example in dynamic, spectral and in situ tomography. CIL
           provides an extensive modular optimisation framework for prototyping reconstruction methods
           including sparsity and total variation regularisation, as well as tools for loading, preprocessing
           and visualising tomographic data."
