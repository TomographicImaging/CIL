from cil.optimisation.functions import Function


class OperatorCompositionFunction(Function):
    
    """ OperatorCompositionFunction

    :math:`F = H \circ A, (H \circ A)(\cdot) = H(A(\cdot))`

    Parameters
    ----------

    function : Function
               A function to be composed with an operator
    operator : Operator
               A general operator


    Note
    ----
    For a general operator, we have no explicit formulas for the :code:`convex_conjugate`,
    the :code:`proximal` and :code:`proximal_conjugate` methods.

    .. todo:: If the operator is unitary, i.e., :math:`A\circ A^{T} = \mathbb{I}`, there is an explicit formula for these methods.

    See Chapter 6 in :cite:`Beck2017` and Tables 1,2 in :cite:`Combettes2011`.
